# control_led_strip
- Raspberry pi zero W
- Adafruit Neopixels (30 strip, configurable but untested)
- Flask interface for controlling Neopixels on RPI
- Flask interface for LDR (sub module project, used to control LEDs based on light readings)


## Due to limitations of using Neopixels and an RPI, the flask app must be ran as ROOT
